# Myopia Clusters

## Background

I am interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. I have been provided with raw data that I will use several clustering algorithms to explore.  I will be looking for whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, Iâ€™ll create a visualization to share my findings.

## Findings

I am unable to find any clustering of values that would provide meaningful analysis. The elbow curve does not have any distinct k values that stand out as a good options for clustering as the line shows basically a smooth curve.

If I was forced to try clustering, I would look at 3 and 5 as the best of poor options.
