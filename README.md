# Myopia Clusters

## Background

I am interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. I have been provided with raw data that I will use several clustering algorithms to explore.  I will be looking for whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, Iâ€™ll create a visualization to share your findings.

## Findings

Based on your findings, write up a brief (one or two sentences) recommendation for your supervisor in your Jupyter Notebook. Can the patients be clustered? If so, into how many clusters?
